Exploratory data analysis, EDA for short, is an initial experimental process to learn useful information and formulate questions 
about a population based on an associated dataset. Some main priorities are examining the data, and preparing it for visualization, 
experimentation or modeling.

The purpose of this notebook is to explain the basics of the EDA process using an example dataset of YouTube data.

## Data Exploration 
In this stage we aim to understand what the data looks like on a high level. 

Some useful libraries for data processing include:
- Pandas
- Numpy

Some useful libraries for data visualization include: 
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
